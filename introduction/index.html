  <div class="content"><h3>Player Comparison: Lebron James</h3><p>At 5'7, you’re a point-guard version of LeBron James’ all-around style. Your mix of three-level slashing, playmaking, ball-handling, and defense mirrors his versatility, while your shooting gives you a reliable perimeter threat that forces defenders to stay honest. Even without LeBron’s size, you bring a similar impact in your own way—using speed, IQ, and competitiveness to influence every possession, create for teammates, and pressure opponents on both ends.</p></div>
