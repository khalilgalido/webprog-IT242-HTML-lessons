  <div class="content"><h3>Player Comparison: Lebron James</h3><p>At 5'7", he’s a point-guard version of LeBron James’ all-around style. His blend of three-level slashing, playmaking, ball-handling, and defense mirrors LeBron’s versatility, while his shooting provides a reliable perimeter threat that keeps defenders honest. Even without LeBron’s size, he brings a similar impact in his own way—using speed, IQ, and competitiveness to influence every possession, create for teammates, and pressure opponents on both ends.</p></div>
